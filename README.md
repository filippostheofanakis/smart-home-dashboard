# Smart Home Dashboard

The Smart Home Dashboard is a cutting-edge full-stack application designed to enable intuitive and centralized management of smart home devices. Leveraging the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it offers users the ability to control and monitor smart devices like lights, thermostats, and security cameras from a single, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Device Control**: Effortlessly turn devices on or off, adjust settings, and control smart home functionalities.
- **Real-time Status**: Get immediate updates on the status of your smart devices, ensuring you're always informed.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access to your dashboard through a robust authentication system, supporting both custom credentials and OAuth providers.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted to deliver a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and serve backend logic.
- **Database**: Employs MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of device data and user preferences.
- **Authentication**: Incorporates secure authentication methods to protect user accounts and data.

- **MongoDB Setup**
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system.
The application expects a database named smartHomeDB with collections as defined in backend/models.


- **Future Enhancements**
Device Integration: Expand the list of compatible smart home devices.
Analytics: Introduce analytics for device usage and environmental impact.
Customization: Allow users to customize the dashboard layout according to their preferences.
